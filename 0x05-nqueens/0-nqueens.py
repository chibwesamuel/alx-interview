N Queens Solver - Solves the N Queens problem using backtracking.

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on
an NÃ—N chessboard. This program will find and print all possible solutions
to the N queens problem, given a specific integer N.

Usage:
    python3 0-nqueens.py N

    where N (int): The size of the chessboard and the number of queens to
    be placed.

Returns:
    None
