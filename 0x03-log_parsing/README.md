# Log Parsing

## Description
This project contains a Python script that reads log data from stdin, computes metrics, and prints statistics after every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).

## Task
### 0. Log parsing
Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on the given input format. The input format is as follows:

```
<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>
```

If the format is not as specified, the line must be skipped.

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption, the script prints the following statistics from the beginning:

1. Total file size: The sum of all previous `<file size>` values.
2. Number of lines by status code: Counts the occurrences of status codes 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, and 500. Status codes should be printed in ascending order.

Note: In this example, the output may vary due to random values.

## Usage
Run the `0-generator.py` script to generate random log data and pipe it into the `0-stats.py` script to compute and display the metrics.

```
./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
```

## Repository
This project can be found in the GitHub repository [alx-interview](https://github.com/chibwesamuel/alx-interview). The specific directory for this task is `0x03-log_parsing`.

I implemented the log parsing script `0-stats.py` that reads log data from stdin, computes metrics, and prints statistics based on the specified input format. The script processes every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) and displays the total file size and the number of lines by status code in ascending order. The example provided in the task demonstrates the script's functionality using random log data generated by `0-generator.py`.
