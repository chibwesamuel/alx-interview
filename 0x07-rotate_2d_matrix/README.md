# Rotate 2D Matrix

This project focuses on implementing a Python function to rotate a given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation is performed in-place, directly modifying the input matrix. The script provided, `main_0.py`, demonstrates the usage of the implemented function and provides a sample input matrix along with the rotated result.

## Task

### Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an n x n 2D matrix, the `rotate_2d_matrix` function rotates it 90 degrees clockwise. The function prototype is as follows:

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    # Function body
```

- The function does not return anything; the matrix is edited in-place.
- The input matrix is assumed to have two dimensions and will not be empty.

## Usage

To test the implementation, run the provided `main_0.py` script. This script imports the `rotate_2d_matrix` function and demonstrates its usage on a sample input matrix. After applying the rotation, the rotated matrix is printed to the console.

```bash
./main_0.py
```
